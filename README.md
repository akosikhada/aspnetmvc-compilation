# ASP.NET MVC: Activities and Practical Exam

This section outlines the hands-on activities and the practical exam designed to solidify your understanding of ASP.NET MVC development.

## **Technologies and Tools Used**

This course utilizes the following technologies and tools:

### **Front-end:**
- **HTML5:** The latest version of the HyperText Markup Language is used for structuring web content and creating web pages.
- **CSS3:** Cascading Style Sheets is utilized for styling HTML elements, enhancing the look and feel of the web application.
- **JavaScript:** A versatile scripting language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular front-end framework that simplifies the development of responsive and mobile-first web applications.

### **Back-end:**
- **C#:** A powerful and versatile programming language used for server-side development in ASP.NET MVC applications.
- **ASP.NET MVC:** A web application framework developed by Microsoft, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It separates the application into three main components:
  - **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
  - **View:** Handles the display and user interface.
  - **Controller:** Processes user input and interacts with the model.
- **Entity Framework:** An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects. It simplifies data access by allowing you to interact with your database using strongly-typed objects.

### **Database:**
- **SQL Server:** A relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is used to store and manage the application's data efficiently.

### **IDE:**
- **Visual Studio 2022:** An integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft, offering a rich set of tools and features for developing, debugging, and deploying .NET applications.

## **Activities**

Throughout this course, you will engage in several practical activities, building progressively more complex applications:

1. **Bio Data:** 
   - Create an application to manage personal information, demonstrating data input, storage, retrieval, and display. 
   - This will reinforce data binding and model usage.
2. **Student Information System:** 
   - Develop a comprehensive application for managing student data, including features like adding, editing, deleting, and searching student records. 
   - This will exercise your skills in database interaction and data management.
3. **Online Ordering System:** 
   - Build a simplified e-commerce application, covering product browsing, adding items to a cart, and order processing. 
   - This activity will integrate various concepts learned throughout the course.
4. **Form Authentication:** 
   - Implement user authentication and authorization using forms-based authentication. 
   - This will cover user registration, login, logout, and potentially role-based access control.

## **Practical Exam: Login System**

The practical exam will focus on building a robust Login System. This will assess your ability to implement secure user authentication, including:

- User registration and account creation
- Secure password storage (hashing)
- Login functionality with session management
- Potential features like "forgot password" functionality

## **Benefits of Completing the Activities and Exam**

By actively participating in these activities and successfully completing the practical exam, you will gain valuable hands-on experience in developing real-world ASP.NET MVC applications. You will also develop your problem-solving skills and learn how to apply your knowledge to practical scenarios.
